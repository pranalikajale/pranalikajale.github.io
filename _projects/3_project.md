The project involved the development of a cruise control system for connected automated vehicles, focusing on maintaining speed harmony with preceding vehicles and ensuring safety distance. By leveraging velocity and acceleration data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity of six preceding vehicles, the system optimizes energy usage—achieving a 5.5% reduction. The system’s design ensures that the vehicle remains 5 meters behind the lead vehicle through precise controller tuning, enhancing both efficiency and safety in automated vehicle convoys.
