The project focused on automating a rear-wheel-drive, front-wheel-steer bicycle model Formula One car using MATLAB. A race line tracking feedback controller was developed to compute the corrective steering angle dynamically by evaluating the deviation of the carâ€™s position from the predefined race line. Additionally, a velocity controller was designed, incorporating constraints on driving and lateral forces, aiming to optimize lap times. This comprehensive approach resulted in achieving an optimized lap time of 171.75 seconds specifically tailored for the Circuit of America track, demonstrating the effectiveness of the controllers in enhancing racing performance.
