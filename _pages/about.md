I am a Master of Engineering student pursuing Automotive Engineering at the University of Michigan, with a strong passion for vehicle dynamics, control systems, and algorithm development. My academic journey has equipped me with expertise in various critical areas, including dynamic system modeling, PID controller design, system identification, and advanced control techniques such as LQR and MPC. To further prepare myself for the challenges of the automotive industry and enhance my problem-solving skills, I have been gaining valuable experience as an ADAS Algorithm Intern at Magna Electronics.In this role, I have been responsible for developing software interfaces and architectures for the design of various ADAS features, including Traffic Sign and Light Recognition (TSR and TLR), Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA), and Auto High Beam Assist (AHBA). My tasks also involve in-depth defect analysis, algorithm testing, and fine-tuning across a range of environments, including MiL, SiL, HiL, and Vehicle System environments.
